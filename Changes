	- Adding author tests

0.35 2002-08-27 RBS
	- Escape whitespace if a blank line is inserted or removed.  This
	  puts a "\n" in the column containing the blank line, for instance.

0.34 2002-07-14 RBS
	- Improved Table format's escaping
	- that "\t" and "\\t" are displayed differently
	- the entire line is escaped consistently if it is escaped
	  at all.

0.33 2002-07-08 RBS
	- Make diff() return "" instead of 0 when comparing two empty
	  things.  Patch from Rolf Grossmann <grossman@progtech.net>.

0.32 2002-03-14 RBS
	- Fix escaping of all-whitespace strings.

0.31 2002-02-06 RBS
	- Remove stray $SIG{__DIE__} that was confessing on every die.

0.3 2001-12-21 RBS
    - undocumented

0.11 2001-12-10 RBS
	- Remove hardcoded date string from t/general.t's test data, because
	  localtime is used to generate this in Diff.pm and the local machine's
	  timezone (and locale?) can cause the localtime for a given mtime to be
	  quite different.  Reported by  Andreas Marcel Riechert
	  <riechert@pobox.com> of cpan-testers.
	- Start this Changes file.
	- Added hunk_header() and hunk_footer() for symmetry in overloading.
	- Added t/ext_format.t

0.1 2001-12-09 RBS
	- Initial public release.
	- Added filename, filehandle, and string I/O options
	- API resembles Algorithm::Diff's a bit more
	- Reimplement output formats as classes so that external (user-supplied)
	  can be specified as class names (My::Diff::Format) and so that they may
	  be inherited from.  Should probably break out hunk_header() from hunk().
	- Add footer() to all formats
