Changes for Perl extension Text-Diff

1.41 Sun 17 Apr 2011
    - Add Text::Dif::Config to MANIFEST.

1.40 Sat 16 Apr 2011
    - Added DIFF_OUTPUT_UNICODE env variable to allow outputting unicode
      characters. Thanks to Shlomi Fish for the patch.

1.37 Thu 16 Jul 2009
	- Switching to a production release
	- Switching to a 1.xx version to indicate this
	- Added META.yml file

1.36_01 Mon 13 Jul 2009
	- Cleaning this up to pass tests
	- Adding author tests

0.35 Tue Aug 27 13:53:23 EDT 2002
	- Escape whitespace if a blank line is inserted or removed.  This
	  puts a "\n" in the column containing the blank line, for instance.

0.34 Sun Jul 14 07:02:51 EDT 2002
	- Improved Table format's escaping
	- that "\t" and "\\t" are displayed differently
	- the entire line is escaped consistently if it is escaped
	  at all.

0.33 Mon Jul  8 16:29:01 EDT 2002
	- Make diff() return "" instead of 0 when comparing two empty
	  things.  Patch from Rolf Grossmann <grossman@progtech.net>.

0.32 Thu Mar 14 13:37:51 EST 2002
	- Fix escaping of all-whitespace strings.

0.31 Wed Feb  6 05:36:47 EST 2002
	- Remove stray $SIG{__DIE__} that was confessing on every die.

0.3 Undocumented (sorry)

0.11 Mon Dec 10 06:23:00 EST 2001
	- Remove hardcoded date string from t/general.t's test data, because
	  localtime is used to generate this in Diff.pm and the local machine's
	  timezone (and locale?) can cause the localtime for a given mtime to be
	  quite different.  Reported by  Andreas Marcel Riechert
	  <riechert@pobox.com> of cpan-testers.
	- Start this Changes file.
	- Added hunk_header() and hunk_footer() for symmetry in overloading.
	- Added t/ext_format.t

0.1
	- Initial public release.
	- Added filename, filehandle, and string I/O options
	- API resembles Algorithm::Diff's a bit more
	- Reimplement output formats as classes so that external (user-supplied)
	  can be specified as class names (My::Diff::Format) and so that they may
	  be inherited from.  Should probably break out hunk_header() from hunk().
	- Add footer() to all formats
